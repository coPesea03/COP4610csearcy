# COP4610 Course Work

Hello! This repository stores my 3 projects from COP4610 (Operating Systems) at Florida State University, with professor Andy Wang.
I do not own any of the prompts or assignments for this course, and, if requested, I will take down this post.
These projects were also developed in groups. Credit to Michael Clark (1, 2, and 3), Shirel Baumgartner (2, 3), and Cesar Marquez (1).

In this course, our 3 projects (and grade recieved) were:
- **Project 1:** Interactive Shell (A)
- **Project 2:** Elevator Kernel Module (A+)
- **Project 3:** FAT32 File System (C+)

These projects were developed in C.

In the end I recieved a B+ for the course.
